# Capstone HTML project ([The microverse capstone project](microverse.org))

This is the Microverse capstone project of the Main HTML/CSS curriculum at [Microverse](https:www.microverse.org/) - @microverseinc. 

It is a fun page I design with html and sass and css based on the ([Mathew Njuguna designs](https://www.behance.net/mathewnjuguna)) designs: 
It has a search result page.
A sign up page.
A homepage. 
Every page is responsive and changes based on the content of the page.
IT is build solely with html and css no grid at all.
